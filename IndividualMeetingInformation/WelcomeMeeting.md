Welcome Discussion with NIMBioS Leadership Team for New Postdocs

The main objective of this discussion is to make sure that you are aware of NIMBioS policies and expectations. Although each discussion will focus on the needs and expectations of each individual, there are a few general points that apply to all. These are summarized below.

1. What we are most concerned about is your success in your career goals. In order for us to be most helpful to you, we therefore need to be kept apprised of your objectives and whether these change during your time here. Throughout, you should feel free to contact the Director or the Associate Director for Postdoctoral Activities, Brian O'Meara, about any aspect of your position here, whether it be related to science, mentoring, career goals, or personal issues. We are here to help, but we won't necessarily be aware of an issue unless you tell us.

2. The NIMBioS Leadership Team and staff are here to help and you should make use of their talents during your time here. Remember that all the staff are professionals and they should be treated as such. This means that if you need their assistance in any way, you should give them fair warning (if this involves anything more than a few moments of their time), and be aware that they have many demands on their time. For IT assistance, please contact the IT Manager, Michael Peek, by email rather than knocking on his door. Similarly, most financial and logistics questions can be dealt with quickly with an email to the Business Manager (Toby Koosman) or Logistics Manager (Jennifer Thomas).

3. Who you should go to for assistance:

    * Financial matters: Toby Koosman
    * Visa issues: Toby Koosman
    * Parking issues: Chandra Eskridge or Toby Koosman
    * Travel arrangements:
        * Turn in travel authorizations (at least five days **before** you travel) and reimbursement requests to Chandra Eskridge. Travel authorizations are required by UT if you are traveling on university business -- even if the university is not paying for it. For vacations, you don't need a travel request, but let Chris Welsh know in advance.

** For plane travel assistance ask Jennifer Spar

** If you request NIMBioS travel funding, turn in the request at least **two weeks** (preferably a month or more) before travel commences to Chris Welsh.

* Page charges for your publications: Discuss these with Chris Welsh
     Our standard policy is that we pay these charges (within reason) if the work was carried out in whole or in part at NIMBioS and you are still in residence. If you are no longer in residence, the work was carried out here, NIMBioS is identified as your affiliation, and you submitted the work for publication while still here, we will cover reasonable page charges. In all cases, we encourage you to seek appropriate sources to cover these from the journal, professional society, UT Research Office, current employer, etc. There is a NIMBioS Policy document on sharing costs for page charges which notes that in general we do not pay separate open access fees for journals that charge this separately from page charges.

* Housing arrangements: Jennifer Spar will do what we can to assist you.
* Research Guidance: Your mentors and the Leadership Team
* Teaching options: The Director
* Summer Undergraduate Research Experience and Minority serving institution visits: Associate Director for Education and Outreach, Suzanne Lenhart.
* Questions about Postdoc Activities/Expectations: Associate Director for Postdoctoral Activities, Brian O'Meara
* Communications training: Catherine Crawley will be in touch regarding a short video, helping you develop your elevator talk and is the main contact for press-releases regarding your research.

4. You have an annual travel budget of up to $3000 to cover travel to conferences, visit collaborators, etc. This is not an upper limit - we have generally been able to increase this as appropriate to the needs for your career goals, but we need to know well in advance if you intend to request significantly more than this. Note that we expect you to seek travel funding from the conference or host institution, particularly if this is for international travel. In general, we expect that if you are traveling to an institution for a job interview, that institution is responsible for your travel expenses. Note that travel to represent NIMBioS at Minority Serving Partners does not count against your travel budget.  A brief trip report is expected to be filed, along with your expense reimbursement form, when NIMBioS supported your travel.

5. Your mentors are not your research directors - they are here to assist you in your career goals, provide advice as appropriate on your research, suggest possible side projects, and invite you to join in their lab group meetings if appropriate. You should choose your mentors within a month of arriving here if at all possible. The procedure is that you meet with potential mentors, and then make a suggestion regarding who you feel is most appropriate to the Associate Director for Postdoctoral Activities.
The mentors will then be asked to confirm that they are willing to assist, and you will be informed about this once we have acceptance. You are expected to meet with your mentors approximately twice a month - these meetings may be part of any regular lab group meetings.

6. NIMBioS Collaborations: We encourage you to be aware of the research emphases of other postdocs and to collaborate with them as appropriate. You are expected to attend the NIMBioS seminar series unless you are traveling, and to participate as appropriate in other seminars/reading groups that align with your interests. You should feel free to set up reading or interest groups with the other postdocs. We have regular gatherings over lunch of postdocs and staff - we encourage attending these as your schedule allows.

7. Activities at NIMBioS - You are encouraged to participate in those of interest to you, but be aware that Working Group membership is approved by the Advisory Board and if you wish to participate in one of these, you will need to be approved by the Associate Director for Scientific Activities, Sergey Gavrilets, and the Working Group organizers. For Workshops and Tutorials, if you wish to fully participate you need to formally apply, and if accepted you are expected to be in attendance throughout the activity. If you merely wish to sit in on a small part of a Workshop or Tutorial, simply inform Chris Welsh that you wish to do so.

8. Short-term visitors - Visits by your collaborators or those you wish to collaborate with are given priority in our evaluations of who to support.

9. Receptions - Each Working Group, Workshop and Tutorial has a reception usually held at the end of their first day. You are encouraged to attend these to network with potential collaborators and/or find out about positions elsewhere. Please attend as your schedule allows even if you are not working in the field of that particular activity.

10.  Many of the incoming postdocs come with multiple e-mail addresses and you will have a NIMBioS and a University of Tennessee e-mail address.  We encourage you to considering forwarding messages to one e-mail address so you do not have to check multiple accounts.  That way you will not miss important announcements.

11. You have been assigned office space and we hope that you will use it.  We do not expect postdocs to be present during specific hours but by being in the NIMBioS office, you are more likely to interact and find mutual interests with the other postdocs.

12. The food available during activities here is for participants. Unused leftovers are fair game for postdocs and other staff once transferred to the staff breakroom (note that the fridge in the staff breakroom furthest from the door is for participant food only -- do not eat).

13. As a full-time UT employee, you are provided with some days for annual leave and sick leave. The expectation is that when you are traveling on NIMBioS business, you do not take annual leave. This includes travel to professional conferences or to any institution in which you are representing NIMBioS. You are expected to report the time off as annual leave if you are not carrying out NIMBioS business on the trip. If the trip is for a job interview, and you discuss your work at NIMBioS as part of the interview, then you do not report this as annual leave time. However, the expectation is also that you will take your vacation leave. Work-life balance is important: if `is.finite(work / life) == TRUE` you are doing something wrong.

14. UT has given authorization for you to be a PI on a grant proposal, if you desire to compose one while here. Before planning to submit one, please discuss this with your mentors and the Director. It can be very time consuming and may well not be worth the investment. If you do decide to compose one, we will need to use internal UT funds to cover your effort on this.

15. Interact with your peers, both socially and intellectually. This is a great time to form collaborations. It's also a time to bond about the unique career challenges of postdocs, do fun things in Knoxville, and get to learn about different ways of doing science and math.
