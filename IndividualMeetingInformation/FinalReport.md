NIMBioS Final Report for Postdoctoral Fellows

1. Report should have two sections, the first being a public one which would be publicly available including posted in some format on the website, and the second being a "private one" that includes items you do not yet wish to openly publicize (e.g. if there is work in progress you do not want public yet).

2. The public section should first start with a 1-2 paragraph summary of the main scientific research results from your time here, to place at the start of the website that gives your final report. Following this, the sections of the final report can be put in mostly outline or list format to include:

    a. Research activities including publications (out and in press and submitted); research presentations at conferences, other institutions and here; collaborations initiated and their status; participation in Working Groups or Workshops

    b. Outreach/education activities including participation in REU or other mentoring activities here, talks given elsewhere for outreach (e.g. MSI talks), participation in such mentoring activities elsewhere (e.g.
mentoring for ESA/SEEDS or SMB at their meetings), collaboration on Bio in a Box or other ed activities.

    c. Training activities including participation in any grant writing workshops, tutorials here or elsewhere, participation in NIMBioS or departmental seminars, participation in NIMBioS discussions on getting jobs, etc.

3. The private section should include research activities not yet published, collaborations that are not firmly established yet, proposals submitted, etc. Included in this should be plans for completion of projects begun but not completed, including whether there is a need for further support of NIMBioS staff or resources.

The report should not include any evaluation of NIMBioS, mentors etc. That is covered in a separate evaluation.

There is an Exit Interview with the Director and Associate Director for Postdoctoral Activities to discuss what projects are remaining here that you are leaving incomplete and might benefit from being worked on by someone else, your comments about our activities, and your suggestions for things we might improve. At this we also discuss your obligation to acknowledge NIMBioS if any of the work was initiated or completed here, and point out that in general we do not support page/paper charges once people leave here but that if the work is closely connected to NIMBioS (e.g. product of a Working Group you were in) or was submitted for publication before you left NIMBioS, then we would contribute to page charges if there is no other support available to you for this.
